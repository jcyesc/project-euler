Highly divisible triangular number
=======================================

Problem 12

The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers.
So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

 1: 1
 3: 1,3
 6: 1,2,3,6
10: 1,2,5,10
15: 1,3,5,15
21: 1,3,7,21
28: 1,2,4,7,14,28
We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?

Questions
==========================================================================

Unknown:  The triangle number that has over five hundred divisors

Can the numbers be positive and negative? No

Do you see any pattern in the given multiples of the first seven triangular numbers? No

Can you devise a plan?
Calculate the triangular numbers as we go using a for loop, then get the multiples of the
triangular number and see if it has more than five hundred divisors.

Calculate the triangular numbers is easy, what is a little bit complicate is to extract
all the divisors.

10 = 2 * 5
20 = 2 * 2 * 5 = 4 * 5

Posible problems
When the triagular numbers are being calculated, it might happen that the number overflow.

Preview
If we want to know how many prime multiples are required to have n different multiples, we apply
this rule.

If we have 3 prime numbers {2, 5, 7} and combine then in all the different ways and multiple them we have.

Multiples
       7         
    5
    5  7
 2
 2     7
 2  5
 2  5  7

So if we want 500 multiples, we need to ask how many prime numbers do we need to create the 500 multiples.
The answer is log2(500) = 9.

The first thing that we need to do is to find a number that has at least 9 prime numbers that are not
repeated of that has a lot of repeated numbers so when we combine them can give us all the multiples
that we need.

Once that we found this number, we need to iterate through all the numbers that are below this number
and see how many multiples we have. If we have more than or equal to the number we are looking for,
we are done, otherwise we continue the searh.


===============================
Running time of the algorithm
===============================

More than O(n ^ 2).

This algorithm depends on where we are going to find the number that we are looking for. That
makes complicated the analysis of this algorithm.

Answer
========
Triangle number and number of all multiples: [76576500, 576]
Prime multiples { 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 }
Total prime numbers including repeated: 11
Triangle number with more than 500 or equal to 500 multiples is: 76576500
