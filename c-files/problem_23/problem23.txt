Non-abundant sums

Problem 23

A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is exactly equal to the
number. For example, the sum of the proper divisors of 28 would be 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, which
means that 28 is a perfect number.

A number n is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than n and it is called
abundant if this sum exceeds n.

As 12 is the smallest abundant number, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, the smallest number that can be
written as the sum of two abundant numbers is 24. By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that
all integers greater than 28123 can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. However, this
upper limit cannot be reduced any further by analysis even though it is known that the greatest
number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two abundant numbers is less than this limit.

Find the sum of all the positive integers which cannot be written as the sum of two abundant numbers.

Questions
==========================================================================

Can the numbers be positive or negative? No, only positive

What is the range of the numbers? 1 to 28123

What subproblems can you see? Once that all the abundant numbers have been found, we have to find
if a given number can be summed by two abundant numbers.

==========
Algorithm
==========
1. Find all the abundant numbers and put them in an array and in a hashtable.
2. Iterate from 1 to 28123 and check if the number can be represent by the sum of two abundant
numbers. If it cannot be expressed as the sum of two abundant numbers, sum it.


===============================
Running time of the algorithm
===============================

The running time of the algorithm is O(n ^ 2).
